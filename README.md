</p>

This project was done as a sequel of an initial submission for electricity price forecasting using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather) datasets.

The data treatment and model setup can be found in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ta97fp/electricity-price-forecasting-model-with-lightgbm).
